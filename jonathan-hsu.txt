(6) we then clone the repo using `git clone HTTPS link`
(7) then we `cd` into the newly created repo
(8) we use git checkout -b "firstname-lastname' to create our own branch
(9) we can now work in our repo
(10) use git add to prep our changes for commiting
(11) commit our changes using `git commit -m "comment on changes"`
(12) use `git push -u origin branch-name` (usually our name)
(13) then, submit a pull request on *our* branch
(14) make sure we change base repo to *our forked repo*
(15) add our TL as a reviewer

Stretch Questions
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Inline elements can be placed along with other elements without creating a new line. Block elements usually take up their own row.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
An element positioned with the `absolute` property will remain in a fixed position relative to its closest ancestor, but can move if the page is scrolled, (unlike fixed, which will remain in the same position even when scrolled) 

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
We can use display: inline-block to give an element the space it needs but also be able to assign it width and height properties.

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default:
(3) <dialog> <div> <section>
(2) <embed> <img>
(1) <input>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
The box model is made up of their margin, border, padding, and content of the element. The box model refers to a conceptual understanding of the space that an element takes up on a webpage, and how its components can be manipulated to place elements exactly where we want them. The drawback of the box model is that it is ineffective for responsive layouts, which are common in the modern day—the padding and margin of elements can overlap and get in the way of each other depending on their sizing. We can use `box-sizing: border-box` to address this issue. It allows us to factor in the padding and border into the height and width so that elements will fit exactly how we want them to.
